# REST

英文 Representational State Transfer，具象的/表述性状态转移，REST 是一种跨平台跨语言的架构风格，在架构层面显得更加整齐划一易于管理和扩展。

JAX-RS 标准是在java语言中对REST风格的Web服务所制定的实现标准。



# DNS

域名系统（DNS）服务器负责将域名映射到具体的IP地址，与搜索域同时使用，可快速前往您常访问的网站和服务器，而无需输入完整地址。

比如：指定搜索域为 apple.com，在浏览器中输入“store” 回车，浏览器将会前往 “store.apple.com” 



# 二进制和国际单位进制

国际单位制的前缀（SI前缀）和二进制前缀（二进制前缀）都是用来表示数据存储容量或传输速率的单位。然而，它们之间存在一些区别，主要体现在单位的基数上。

1. **国际单位制的前缀（SI前缀）：** 这些前缀是根据国际单位制（SI）定义的，用于表示十进制单位。在SI前缀中，每个前缀的基数都是10的幂次方。例如：
   - 1 KB（千字节）= 1000 字节
   - 1 MB（兆字节）= 1000 KB = 1,000,000 字节
   - 1 GB（吉字节）= 1000 MB = 1,000,000 KB = 1,000,000,000 字节
2. **二进制前缀（二进制前缀）：** 为了更准确地表示计算机内存和存储容量，引入了二进制前缀，基数为2的幂次方。这些前缀更适合计算机内部的数据存储。例如：
   - 1 KiB（千字节）= 1024 字节
   - 1 MiB（兆字节）= 1024 KiB = 1,048,576 字节
   - 1 GiB（吉字节）= 1024 MiB = 1,048,576 KiB = 1,073,741,824 字节

所以，主要的区别在于计算单位的基数。在实际使用中，这两种表示法可能会引起混淆。通常，硬盘厂商和操作系统使用国际单位制前缀，而计算机科学和内存表示则更倾向于使用二进制前缀。

在计算机领域，要注意上下文并了解使用的是哪种前缀，以避免混淆。



# Host

在计算机操作系统中，"hosts" 是一个文本文件，用于将主机名（域名）映射到相应的 IP 地址。它通常用于在没有域名服务器的情况下进行本地主机名解析，以便将域名解析为对应的 IP 地址，从而在网络通信中定位特定的计算机或服务器。

每个操作系统都有一个位于特定位置的 hosts 文件，用于在本地进行主机名到 IP 地址的映射。当你尝试在计算机上访问某个域名时，操作系统会首先检查 hosts 文件中是否已经存在该域名的映射记录，如果存在，则会使用该记录中的 IP 地址来定位目标服务器，而不需要向域名服务器发送查询请求。

这个文件的格式通常是每行一个映射记录，格式为：

```properties
IP地址 主机名 [别名1 别名2 ...]
```

举个例子，如果在 hosts 文件中有以下记录：

```properties
127.0.0.1 localhost
```

这表示将主机名 "localhost" 映射到 IP 地址 127.0.0.1，这是一个常见的本地回环地址，通常用于指代本地计算机。

需要注意的是，修改 hosts 文件需要管理员权限（或超级用户权限），因为这可能会影响计算机的网络连接和域名解析行为。人们有时会修改 hosts 文件来进行一些特定的网络配置，如屏蔽广告域名、测试网站迁移等。
